# PetHub Backend Deployment Status

## Current Issue
Vercel is deploying from commit `10b0eeb` (Initial commit) instead of the latest commits with TypeScript fixes.

## Latest Commits with Fixes
- `d17b476` - Force Vercel deployment with version bump
- `2f01653` - Trigger new Vercel deployment with latest fixes  
- `3c42f14` - Fix TypeScript linting errors for Vercel deployment
- `e5fc273` - Add Vercel deployment configuration

## TypeScript Fixes Applied
✅ Fixed `any` type in register.ts
✅ Fixed `any` type in medical-record files
✅ Removed unused error parameters
✅ Removed unused NextApiRequest import

## Solution Required
Vercel needs to be reconfigured to use the latest commit with all fixes applied.
